# AdaptiveCAD Playground - User Guide

This guide explains how to use the AdaptiveCAD Playground interface, including all available basic shapes, advanced shapes, and modeling tools.

## Getting Started

You can start the AdaptiveCAD Playground in several ways:

1. Using the VS Code task:
   - Run the "Run AdaptiveCAD GUI Playground" task

2. Using one of the provided scripts:
   - `run_full_playground.py` - Python script to run the full playground
   - `run_full_playground.bat` - Windows batch file to run the full playground
   - `run_full_playground.ps1` - PowerShell script to run the full playground

## Interface Overview

The AdaptiveCAD Playground interface consists of:

- **Menubar**: Contains menus for Basic Shapes, Advanced Shapes, and Modeling Tools
- **Toolbar**: Quick access to common shapes and modeling operations
- **3D Viewer**: Main area showing the 3D scene
- **Status Bar**: Shows messages and current operations
- **Grid Toggle**: Enable or disable the viewport grid from *Settings → View → Show Grid*

## Basic Shapes

The following basic shapes are available:

- **Box**: Create a rectangular box by specifying width, depth, and height
- **Cylinder**: Create a cylinder by specifying radius and height
- **Ball**: Create a sphere by specifying radius
- **Torus**: Create a torus (donut) by specifying major and minor radii
- **Cone**: Create a cone by specifying base radius and height

## Advanced Shapes

The following advanced parametric shapes are available:

- **Superellipse**: Create a superellipse shape (rounded rectangle with adjustable roundness)
  - Parameters: X radius, Y radius, exponent (n), segments

- **Pi Curve Shell (πₐ)**: Create a parametric surface based on πₐ curves
  - Parameters: Base radius, height, frequency, amplitude, phase

- **Helix/Spiral**: Create a helical or spiral shape
  - Parameters: Base radius, height, pitch, turns, wire radius

- **Tapered Cylinder**: Create a cylinder with different top and bottom radii
  - Parameters: Bottom radius, top radius, height

- **Capsule/Pill**: Create a pill/capsule shape (cylinder with hemispherical ends)
  - Parameters: Radius, height

- **Ellipsoid**: Create an ellipsoid (stretched sphere)
  - Parameters: X radius, Y radius, Z radius

For detailed documentation on advanced shapes, see [ADVANCED_SHAPES.md](ADVANCED_SHAPES.md)

## Modeling Tools

The following modeling tools are available:

### Transformation Tools

- **Move**: Translate a shape in 3D space
  - Select a shape, then enter X, Y, Z translation values

- **Scale**: Resize a shape uniformly
  - Select a shape, then enter a scale factor

### Boolean Operations

- **Union**: Combine two shapes (Boolean OR)
  - Select two shapes to combine them into one

- **Cut**: Subtract one shape from another (Boolean difference)
  - First select the base shape, then select the shape to subtract

- **Intersect**: Create the common volume between two shapes (Boolean AND)
  - Select two shapes to create their intersection

### Other Operations

- **Shell**: Create a hollow version of a solid with specified wall thickness
  - Select a shape and specify the wall thickness

For detailed documentation on modeling tools, see [MODELING_TOOLS.md](MODELING_TOOLS.md)

## Workflow Tips

1. **Create Basic Shapes First**: Start by creating the basic primitive shapes you need

2. **Position Shapes**: Use the Move tool to position shapes correctly before applying boolean operations

3. **Apply Boolean Operations**: Use Union, Cut, and Intersect to combine shapes

4. **Add Advanced Shapes**: Add advanced parametric shapes for more complex geometries

5. **Apply Finishing Operations**: Use Shell to hollow out shapes if needed

## Troubleshooting

- **If shapes don't appear**: Make sure the view is properly zoomed (use mouse wheel)

- **If boolean operations fail**: Check that shapes properly overlap or intersect

- **If the application crashes**: Check that you have all dependencies installed by running `check_environment.py`

## Getting Help

For additional help, refer to:
- [README.md](README.md) - General overview of the project
- [ADVANCED_SHAPES.md](ADVANCED_SHAPES.md) - Details on advanced shape parameters
- [MODELING_TOOLS.md](MODELING_TOOLS.md) - Details on modeling operations

## Analytic Viewport Overlays (Anisotropic Distance)


## Radial Tool Wheel (Analytic Viewport)

The Analytic viewport now exposes a shared radial HUD wheel so every panel uses the same tool map. Hover near the viewport edge to fade it in, spin with the mouse wheel or right-drag to rotate, and click to trigger a tool.

### Default Segments
- Sketch: Polyline, Line, Arc 3pt, Circle, Rect, Insert Vertex, Dim
- Gizmo: Move, Rotate, Scale
- Utilities: Center on Selected, Reset Camera, Undo Last
- Scene: Showcase, Clear

### Panel Settings
Open the Analytic panel and expand **HUD Wheel** to tweak behaviour:
- **Enabled** toggles the overlay without removing your last configuration
- **Fit To Edge / Overshoot** decides whether the ring hugs the viewport border
- **Thickness / Opacity / Text Size** control readability and footprint
- **Auto Spin + Speed** adds or disables ambient rotation (defaults off)

Settings persist in `~/.adaptivecad_analytic.json`, so the wheel keeps your preferences between sessions.

### Quick Tips
- The wheel fades out near the centre so it never hides sketch geometry
- Labels dim except the hovered segment for quick targeting
- If you do not see the wheel, ensure **HUD Wheel > Enabled** is checked and the cursor is near the viewport edge

### Quick demo actions

Inside the Analytic Viewport panel, the Actions group now includes:

- Showcase Primitives: instantly populates a small curated set of SDF shapes (Sphere, Torus, Mobius, Superellipsoid, Gyroid, Trefoil), positioned for visibility.
- Clear Scene: removes all SDF primitives and clears any polyline overlays.

These help you demo the analytic renderer quickly or reset between tests.
